file1 = rpm -qa (production server)
file2 = rpm -qa (test server)

Compare file1 with file2 and generate a file3 which contains the lines in file1 which are not present in file2

comm - compare two sorted files line by line

SYNOPSIS
       comm [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2

...

       -1     suppress lines unique to FILE1

       -2     suppress lines unique to FILE2

       -3     suppress lines that appear in both files

			sort file1 > file1a
			sort file2 > file2a
			comm -2 -3 file1a file2a > fil3a ( entries available on file1a and not available on file2a) - Packages to be installed on Test Servers
			comm -1 -3 file1a file2a > fil3b ( entries available on file2a and not available on file1a) - Packages to be removed from Test servers



yum -y install $(cat file3a)
for i in `cat file3a` ; do yum -y install $i; done

List which RPMs which will be erased, without actually erasing them:


rpm -e --test -vv $(cat file3b) 2>&1 | grep '^D:     erase:'
rpm -e $(cat file3b)
for i in `cat file3b` ; do rpm -e $i; done


As first step we need to create a file with all rpm packages installed on the servers using the commnads described bellow

rpm -qa > file1 (production server)
rpm -qa > file2 (test server)

The files have to be first sorted using the following commands

sort file1 > file1a
sort file2 > file2a

Then compare line by line both files to get the differences

comm -2 -3 file1a file2a > file3a (packages only present on production server)

comm -1 -3 file1a file2a > file3b (Packages only present on test server)

First test completed with success
